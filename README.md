# QuadraticExpressionSolver

The QuadraticExpressionSolver repository contains a C program that evaluates a specific quadratic expression.
The expression involves constants 'c', 'x', and 'y' and follows the formula k = 2 × c × x*x−y*y/ 2π .
The program takes user-defined values for 'c', 'x', and 'y', calculates the result using the expression, and then prints the value of 'k'.
